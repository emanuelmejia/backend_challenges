# Homework 09 
This repository contains starter code for Homework 09. 

## Your tasks 
All of the questions that you must answer are in the file `unit_09.Rmd`. You should answer these questions by reading, thinking, and if necessary, writing code that produces evidence. Your code must: 

- compile without errors; and,  
- be able to `knit` to produce a PDF with your results. 

## Submitting your work
You are responsible for taking two actions to complete your homework: 

1. You must submit a PDF of your work (which you can `knit` in Rstudio) to Gradescope. In Rstudio, you can download the PDF that you knit by "checking the box" next to the file, clicking the gear, and then clicking "export". A screen shot of this process is at the bottom of this README.md. (Please note that in the screen shot, we are actually showing a download of a file called `README.md`, you should be downloading your completed homework PDF.) 
2. You must push your work from your ischool.datahub.berkeley.edu compute environment back to this upstream repository so that the instructional team has access to your whole repository. 

## Assessment of your work
It is not possible for us to grade *every*  part of this assignment and return feedback to you in a way that is quick enough for you to use it moving forward through the rest of the class. And so, we will be assessing your work in the following way: 

- The TAs will be spot-checking specific parts of this homework for completeness and accuracy. 
- We will be running your code to validate that it compiles without errors. 

## Completing the learning cycle 
When you are writing code to produce solutions, please, *please* do not think of your learning on the homework as being complete when you have submitted your answers. Instead, we encourage you to: 


- take a day of rest after having submitted your work;  
- when the solutions are released, compare how you have solved the work to how the instructional team has solved it; and, 
- come to an office hour and talk with an instructor or TA about different approaches! 

When you present your approach, or see how others have approached the work, you're able to see and evaluate several different methods, and learn which methods work best.
